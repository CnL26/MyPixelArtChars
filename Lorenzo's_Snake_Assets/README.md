Here i will be crwating pixel art assets for old school snake games.
This started as me trying to help a buddy of mine-'Pyguru', find some nice snake gameart.
Unfortunately the ones i came across wasnt the style i was going for so i decided to make our own!
Interestingly enough they are coming out better than expected! If beginning coding and building games or helping others with a tutorial, feel free to use these graphics. Would love to see them on YouTube or any game site!
credit it appreciated but not required!!!
